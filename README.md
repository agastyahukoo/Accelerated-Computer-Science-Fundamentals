## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a course module or topic:

- **Module 1:** Basic Programming Constructs  
- **Module 2:** Data Structures  
- **Module 3:** Algorithms and Complexity  
- **Module 4:** Advanced Topics  

Each directory includes well-documented source files (`.cpp`) and, where applicable, input/output examples for better understanding.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run these programs, ensure you have:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (optional, for build automation)
- A development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or any IDE of your choice)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/accelerated-cs-fundamentals.git
   cd accelerated-cs-fundamentals
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired module and compile the program:  
   ```bash
   g++ -o program_name source_file.cpp
   ./program_name
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the program's comments for any input requirements.
